# Heart Failure Prediction

###  <ins> Project Objective</ins>

In this project the aim is to understand and predict heart failure. It is binary classification, which means we either have 1 for death or 0 for survival. 

Using several exploratory research approaches, such as data visualization and data frames using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for both categorical and continuous variables. The dataset has been divided using various categorization techniques for machine learning prediction.
Finally, we compare the various methods and depict the various accuracies using a bar chart.

####  Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Dataset
